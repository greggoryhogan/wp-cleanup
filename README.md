# WP Cleanup

Remove the unneccessary bloat WordPress adds. Use with caution, this is very specific to installations that want to disable Gutenberg. Please note, this is NOT the same plugin as WP Cleanup in the WP Repo. 

In addition to disabling Gutenberg, this plugin removes:

- File editing from wp-admin
- Wp-generator and feed links
- WordPress Customizer and it's admin capabilties
- Emoji support
- Trackbacks and slug editor
