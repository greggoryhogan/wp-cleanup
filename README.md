# WP Cleanup

Remove the unneccessary bloat WordPress adds. Use with caution, this is very specific to installations that want to disable Gutenberg. In addition to disabling Gutenberg, this plugin removes:

- File editing from wp-admin
- Wp-generator and feed links
- WordPress Customizer and it's admin capabilties
- Emoji support
- Trackbacks and slug editor
